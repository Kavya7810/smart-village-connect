---

## 📖 Overview

**Smart Village Connect** is a digital solution aimed at solving key challenges in rural areas — from healthcare access and government transparency to local economic empowerment. This platform provides a centralized interface for villagers to connect with services that were previously out of reach.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

Rural communities lack seamless access to:

- 🏥 Basic healthcare and teleconsultation
- 🏛️ Government schemes and project visibility
- 📢 Community announcements
- 💼 Market opportunities for local sellers

Smart Village Connect bridges these gaps with a secure, intuitive, and scalable web platform.
